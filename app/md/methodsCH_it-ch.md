An overview of the current epidemiological situation in Switzerland based on the reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> and other indicators can be found [here](https://sciencetaskforce.ch/en/news-english/). More extensive updates of the epidemiological situation are published by the Science Task Force in the form of [Policy Briefs](https://ncs-tf.ch/en/policy-briefs).

<h4>Caveats</h4>

In general, we note that the R<sub>e</sub> estimates for the last days may still be consolidated during subsequent days. This consolidation in particular occurs for small regions, during changes in the dynamics, and in case of small case numbers. We thus base our interpretation on estimated trends over several days. In particular, we further provide a 7-day estimate.

However, due to the high test positivity rate and delayed hospital reports during the second wave, estimates based on the case numbers and hospitalizations may be too low during this time. The R<sub>e</sub> based on positivity (confirmed cases/tests) is reliable if the persons tested are a random cross section of the population; since we test specifically symptomatic persons, this R<sub>e</sub> value may also be biased. During the second wave, the R<sub>e</sub> value based on deaths is the most reliable. However, this R<sub>e</sub> value reflects the epidemiological situation with a time lag of about 3 weeks. The reason is that it takes about 17 days between new infection and death.

R<sub>e</sub> values above 1 during the summer were not a consequence of an increased testing effort or of false positive test results. The number of weekly tests indeed increased substantially over the summer. Simultaneously however, the percentage of positive tests among all tests (i.e. the test positivity rate) increased from 0.4% in June to >20% in October. This also means that we estimate R<sub>e</sub> based on the positivity rate to be significantly above 1 for most of the summer. Additionally, the specificity of PCR tests is very high, leading to essentially no false positive results which could bias our estimates.

<h4>Methods</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the estimated median with the 95% uncertainty interval. The method to estimate R<sub>e</sub> is described [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20239368v2.full-text). 
We further provide a 7-day estimate. This estimate is obtained by assuming a constant R<sub>e</sub> over the last seven days. The results of such a piecewise constant procedure can be viewed visually using the option "Step-wise constant".

Since June, we first smooth the data with a LOESS step, and then estimate the infection dates using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step (discussed [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20307) and [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409)). Then, we estimate R<sub>e</sub>  using the [EpiEstim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html) software from the estimated infection dates. Results based on data from June 26, 2020 using the original method can be accessed [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271).

Since June 2020, all estimates of R<sub>e</sub> for Switzerland are based on data from the FOPH. On weekdays, the FOPH communicates the number of newly confirmed cases that they received over the last 24 hours. These cases typically stem from the last three days. To estimate R<sub>e</sub> we therefore analyze the number of newly confirmed cases from each particular day ignoring the past two days. As a result, the numbers in our dashboard are different from the numbers given in the daily FOPH situation reports.

**UPDATE (25.1.2021)**: We now construct 95% confidence intervals based on a block bootstrapping procedure. We found in simulations that this new procedure better reflects the uncertainty in the parameter estimates compared to our previous procedure. We are currently writing up an explanation of the new procedure and will post it as soon as it is available. In the meantime, the method can be accessed through our [code](https://github.com/covid-19-Re/shiny-dailyRe). Our general approach (up to the bootstrapping procedure) is explained [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20239368v2.full-text).

**Update (15.2.2021)**: We now take the R<sub>e</sub> estimate on the original data as the R<sub>e</sub> point estimate, replacing the mean of the bootstrap replicates. The aim is to make the point estimate more stable. 
Further, we use the uncertainty intervals from EpiEstim in case it is larger than the bootstrapping interval in order to obtain conservative uncertainty intervals.
Updated code is available [here](https://github.com/covid-19-Re/shiny-dailyRe).
